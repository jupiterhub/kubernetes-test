- Kubernetes allows you to scale your app very easily using replicas, the commands doesn't change whether you use it on local machine, private cloud, or public cloud. This is the future of deployment and I highly recommend you start using it for your projects

The basic definition are ```Cluster``` contains ```Nodes``` which contains ```Pods``` and a ```Service``` which goes accross pods and allows your service to be publicly accessible
